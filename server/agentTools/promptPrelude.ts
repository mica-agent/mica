// Unified prompt prelude — same prose for every agent (qwen, Claude,

export function buildAgentToolsPrelude(): string {
  return `## Mica tools (available across all agent backends)

These tools come from Mica itself — same names, same input/output shape, same prose regardless of which backend you are (qwen, Claude, or opencode). They reach Mica's REST surface via your SDK's MCP plumbing; you call them by name like any other tool.

### Visual verification

\`render_capture\` — verify a rendered card. Captures a PNG of the card on the canvas and returns a text result whose first line is a verdict tag — \`[render_capture: CLEAN]\`, \`[render_capture: ERRORS — N buffered]\`, \`[render_capture: WEBGL-OPAQUE]\`, or \`[render_capture: CAP-REACHED]\`. The tag tells you the next move; follow it. CLEAN means write your final summary and end the turn. ERRORS means fix each listed error and re-capture. WEBGL-OPAQUE means apply the onCapture hook or trust the user's on-screen view. Input: \`{ filename: 'canvas/<name>.<ext>' }\` (instance file, not class dir). The browser tab must be open to the project's canvas.

### Card-class-private server compute — sidecars

When a card class needs server-side compute (ML inference, vector search, RAG, file scanning, anything that needs persistent state across calls, anything you'd otherwise reach for \`mica_shell\` to run a Python script per query) — declare a **sidecar** in the card class's \`metadata.json\` and ship a \`server.py\` or \`server.ts\` alongside \`card.js\`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "sidecar": {
    "entry": "server.py",
    "ready_path": "/health",
    "ready_timeout_ms": 30000
  }
}
\`\`\`

Mica spawns the sidecar on the first call from \`card.js\`, manages its lifecycle (lazy-spawn, idle-shutdown at 10 min, orphan-reaper at backend startup), and exposes it via \`mica.fetch('mica-internal://card-server/<path>')\`. The sidecar reads \`MICA_PORT\` from env (assigned from pool 8200-8299), binds 127.0.0.1, and must implement the \`ready_path\` endpoint. Runtime auto-detected from the entry file extension: \`.py\` → Python, \`.ts\`/\`.tsx\` → tsx, \`.js\`/\`.mjs\` → node.

The classic signal you need a sidecar: you'd otherwise tell the LLM to run a Python script via \`mica_shell\` per query (vector search, embedding generation, RAG). Move that compute into the card class. Latency drops from multi-second LLM-orchestrated round-trips to ~50ms warm calls. The full schema, server templates, lifecycle facts, and pitfalls are in \`card-class-handbook\` § Card-class-private sidecars — read it before authoring.

**The sidecar pattern is HTTP-adapter-for-a-library.** The 80% case: you pick the canonical Python/Node package for your capability (sentence-transformers for embeddings, FAISS for vector search, pymupdf for PDFs, etc.), wrap it in a small FastAPI / \`node:http\` service, and expose JSON endpoints. The handbook ships four worked examples (\`hello-llm\`, \`hello-embed\`, \`hello-faiss\`, \`hello-pdf\`) that ARE the pattern — copy the matching one, swap 2-3 lines, done.

**For Mica-owned capabilities, use \`mica_sidecar\` (not the library).** The local LLM is the one capability Mica owns end-to-end (URL, model, vLLM \`enable_thinking\` trap, auth). The sidecar code never sees any of it:

\`\`\`python
import mica_sidecar as mica   # template-provided alias

resp = mica.llm.chat(messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "Summarize in one sentence."},
    {"role": "user",   "content": text},
])
# resp.text → reply string
mica.log("got reply, model =", resp.model)
\`\`\`

TypeScript: \`import mica from "mica-sidecar"; await mica.llm.chat({ messages: [...] });\`.

**Surface boundary:** \`mica_sidecar\` (server) and \`mica\` (client global in card.js) are DIFFERENT packages with non-overlapping surfaces. \`mica.fetch\` / \`mica.openChannel\` exist client-only; \`mica.llm.chat\` / \`mica.log\` / \`mica.project_dir\` exist sidecar-only. Do NOT pattern-match across them. If you see \`AttributeError\` involving mica on the sidecar, you're calling a client-only method — check the handbook's Pitfalls.

**For everything else (embeddings, vector store, PDF, OCR, audio, image gen, ...), import the canonical package directly.** Mica doesn't provide wrappers — the library API IS the API. AI generation is more reliable against well-known packages than against Mica-invented shims.

**When a sidecar fetch returns HTTP 5xx, call \`mica_sidecar_log({ card_class: "<name>" })\` FIRST — before editing code.** The sidecar's exception handler emits the full Python/TS traceback to stdout, which Mica captures into a per-class ring buffer (survives the sidecar crashing). The traceback names the exact file, line, and exception type. Pattern-matching the short error message you got from \`mica.fetch\` (e.g. "Upload failed (HTTP 500)") consistently lands the agent on the wrong line; the traceback tells you the right one. Use this INSTEAD of composing \`mica_shell tail backend.log | grep card-sidecar:<name>\` — same data, one tool call, no path or pattern to remember.

**After editing \`server.py\` / \`server.ts\`, call \`mica_restart_sidecar\` to force a respawn.** The running sidecar holds the OLD bytecode in memory and won't pick up file changes. Do NOT reach for \`mica_shell pkill ...\` — pkill matches the bash subprocess's own argv against the pattern (\`pkill -f "rag-chat"\` from inside \`bash -c 'pkill -f "rag-chat"'\` matches itself, and possibly the agent CLI whose argv contains the user's prompt) and suicide-kills the agent. Use \`mica_restart_sidecar({ card_class: "<name>" })\` instead: server-side SIGTERM via the tracked PID, no bash in the loop, returns when the old process is gone. Next \`mica.fetch\` from card.js triggers the lazy respawn.

**The full sidecar debug loop is two calls:** (1) \`mica_sidecar_log\` to read the traceback, (2) edit the file the traceback points at, (3) \`mica_restart_sidecar\` to make the fix take effect, (4) ask the user to retry. If the same error returns after a clean restart, your diagnosis was wrong — call \`mica_sidecar_log\` again and look at the traceback more carefully (especially the line number); do NOT iterate edits without re-reading the new traceback.

### Shell — use \`mica_shell\`, NOT \`run_shell_command\`

\`mica_shell\` — runs shell commands with Mica's safety guards. The SDK's built-in \`run_shell_command\` is excluded from your tool surface in this session because it bypasses our guards in yolo mode. Use \`mica_shell\` for ALL shell needs (curl, ls, grep, git, npm, etc.). Same parameters as \`run_shell_command\` (\`command\`, \`description\`, \`is_background\`, \`cwd\`, \`timeout\`) plus refusal-with-reason for commands that would: kill Mica's backend (pkill tsx, kill <backend-pid>), kill Mica's ports (3002/5173/8012/8013), run scripts/stop.sh/restart.sh/start.sh from inside the agent (you run INSIDE the backend's process tree — these kill you mid-call), or place card-class files outside \`.mica/card-classes/\`. Returns structured \`{ exit_code, stdout, stderr, duration_ms }\` as JSON text. If you genuinely need a backend restart, ASK THE USER — they're outside your process tree.

### Library-skills discovery

\`mica_list_skill_packages\` — list Mica's curated library-skills packs (the ones \`mica_install_skills\` accepts as shorthands). When discover-dependency surfaces a library, check this list to see if there's a curated skill pack for it. If yes, install via \`mica_install_skills source="<pack>"\` before writing code that uses the library — the pack carries patterns the base model misses (container sizing, init order, disposer rules). One call per build is enough; the list is short and stable.

### Dependency-URL verification — \`mica_inspect_url\`, NOT raw curl

\`mica_inspect_url\` — server-side inspection of a candidate dependency URL. Does the work of \`curl -sI\` + \`curl -s | head\` in one call but returns ~300-500 bytes of structured JSON instead of 1-3KB of raw body that would sit in chat history. Input: \`{ url }\`. Output: \`{ ok, status, contentType, sizeBytes, format, bodyHint, methods? }\` where \`format\` is \`'UMD' | 'ESM' | 'CommonJS' | 'data' | 'unknown'\`. Use this INSTEAD of curl for every library / plugin verification — it keeps the body bytes out of chat history and gives the format detection structurally. UMD = browser-loadable; CommonJS or ESM = WON'T load as a \`<script>\` in a card class (mark unverified for browser use). On 404 the result includes a \`reason\` with the jsdelivr file-listing pivot for the package. The optional \`methods\` array (extracted from the body sample) is the antidote to runtime \`X.method is not a function\` errors — read it when the agent has hallucinated a method name. Raw curl is still right for: jsdelivr file listings on 404 pivot, CORS header checks on asset URLs, and live-service smoke tests.

### Web tools — pick by content shape

Four outside-the-project lookup tools. Two real costs to weigh on each call:
- **Wall clock**: how long the call takes.
- **Context cost**: how much of the response enters chat history permanently. The 131K-token context is finite — exceeding it ends the build with HTTP 400.

- **\`curl\`** (via \`run_shell_command "curl -sI -L <url>"\` or \`curl -s <url>\`) — ~200ms wall clock. The ENTIRE response enters chat history. Right for structured small responses: CDN URL reachability, CORS checks, npm registry JSON, jsdelivr listings, API smoke-tests, plain markdown READMEs. Always append \`| head -c <N>\` to bound the output.

- **\`mica_inspect_url\`** — server-side dependency probe. Returns ~300-500 bytes structured JSON regardless of source size. Use this INSTEAD of curl for any library/plugin you'll commit to a spec — the body bytes never enter chat history.

- **\`mcp__tavily__tavily_search\`** — *discovering* something you don't know (a plugin name, a canonical host, a free-tier API). Returns title + snippet + URL per result. **Always cap \`max_results\` at 5** — each result pushes ~600-1500 tokens into chat history. **Pass \`max_results\` as a number (\`5\`), not a string (\`"5"\`)** — the MCP schema rejects strings silently as "tool not available". The full registered name includes the MCP server prefix; the bare \`tavily_search\` returns "tool not found".

- **\`web_fetch\`** — downloads a page AND routes it through an LLM with your \`prompt:\` field. ~4 minutes wall clock on local-model projects, but **only the extracted answer enters chat history** — a few hundred chars regardless of source size. **Use for HTML pages with structure cruft (docs sites, blog posts, multi-answer SO threads) where curl would dump 50KB+ of nav/footer into permanent context just so you can scan for one fact.** Don't use for: structured JSON (use curl), plain markdown READMEs (use curl, no LLM needed), or single-fact URL verification (use mica_inspect_url).

**The rule of thumb**: prefer curl for structured/small responses; \`web_fetch\` for HTML-heavy pages where the answer is one paragraph in 50KB of cruft. Both have costs — pick the lower TOTAL cost (wall clock + permanent context bloat across the rest of the session).

### File-write decision rule

Four paths in a Mica project have structured tools that own their schema and lint. Use the structured tool for these; \`write_file\` is right for everything else.

- \`.mica/card-classes/<name>/card.{js,html,css}\` → \`mica_edit_class_file\`
- \`.mica/card-classes/<name>/metadata.json\` → \`mica_create_class\` (it serializes from typed inputs; re-call with same name + same extension to UPDATE existing metadata in place — DO NOT delete-then-recreate to change a dependency or badge)
- new card instance under canvas-root (e.g. \`canvas/foo.world-clock\`) → \`mica_create_card_instance\`
- \`.mica/layout.json\` → don't write at all (runtime state owned by the canvas card)

Everything else — \`spec.md\`, \`decomposition.md\`, \`questions.md\`, \`README.md\`, free-form markdown, generated data files, anything the user asked you to author — \`write_file\` is the right tool.

### Build flow — invoke \`develop\` first

For any build-shaped request ("build / create / implement / make / write / design / ship / develop / construct" — for a card class, standalone program, doc set, or any non-trivial artifact), your FIRST tool call is \`skill('develop')\`. That skill owns the universal flow: spec on canvas → plan-or-inline gate → library discovery → execute (branches by artifact type to \`card-class-handbook\` or \`write_file\` or task decomposition) → canvas update → verify → doc-consistency reconcile.

Do NOT invoke \`card-class-handbook\`, \`decompose-task\`, or any other build-flow skill directly without first invoking \`develop\` — those are downstream specifics that \`develop\` dispatches to at the right step. Skipping \`develop\` means skipping the plan-before-build and canvas-update invariants that apply to every build regardless of artifact type.

### Tool prerequisites (gates enforced at the tool boundary)

Two card-class tools have prerequisites that they enforce server-side. If you call them without meeting the prerequisites, they return a structured error with a \`Next:\` line telling you what to do — read it and follow it on your next tool call.

- \`mica_create_class\` requires:
  - A \`canvas/<name>-spec.md\` file exists with non-trivial content (the spec from develop step 2). If absent, the tool returns "No spec found at canvas/<name>-spec.md. Per develop step 2, write the spec first…".
  - For each curated library mentioned in the spec, the matching \`<lib>-skills\` package must be installed (currently: Three.js → \`threejs-skills\`). The tool returns "Spec uses <Library>, but <pack> is not installed…". Invoke \`mica_install_skills source="<pack>"\` to satisfy the gate. Library-specific skills carry Mica patterns (container sizing for WebGL, init order, disposer rules) the base model misses.
  - \`skill('card-class-handbook')\` has been invoked in this chat session. If not, the tool returns "Invoke skill('card-class-handbook') as your next tool call…".
- \`mica_edit_class_file\` requires:
  - \`skill('card-class-handbook')\` has been invoked in this chat session. Bug fixes and refactors don't need a fresh spec, but they DO need the contract the handbook documents.

These gates exist because the develop flow keeps getting compressed in working memory across multi-turn builds — the handbook step in particular tends to be skipped. The rejection makes the gate self-correcting: read the error, take the next move it tells you, retry. You don't have to remember the prerequisites — the tool reminds you.`;
